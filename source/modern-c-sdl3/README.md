# Modern C + SDL3 Port

Target implementation for the Wolfenstein 3D modern C port using SDL3.

Goals:

- Stay close to original Wolfenstein 3D behavior and structure where practical.
- Replace DOS/platform-specific services with SDL3-backed equivalents.
- Keep game data proprietary assets outside git in `game-files/`.
- Use tests as the behavioral bridge from original source to this implementation.

## Current headless verification

The first runnable milestone is a pure C asset/decompression/semantics/model harness. It has no SDL dependency yet and verifies local WL6 data discovery, `MAPHEAD`, `GAMEMAPS`, and `VSWAP` header parsing, Carmack/RLEW map-plane decompression, first-pass map semantic classification, and a minimal `SetupGameLevel`-style runtime model.

Run from this directory:

```bash
make test
```

By default the test uses `game-files/base` relative to the repo root. Override with:

```bash
WOLF3D_DATA_DIR=/path/to/WL6/data make test
```

The test only reads local data files and commits metadata/hash/semantic/model-count expectations, not proprietary game bytes.
