# Modern C + SDL3 Port

Target implementation for the Wolfenstein 3D modern C port using SDL3.

Goals:

- Stay close to original Wolfenstein 3D behavior and structure where practical.
- Replace DOS/platform-specific services with SDL3-backed equivalents.
- Keep game data proprietary assets outside git in `game-files/`.
- Use tests as the behavioral bridge from original source to this implementation.
