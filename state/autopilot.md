# Autopilot State

Status: active

## Current Phase

First runnable modern C asset-loader metadata tests are implemented and passing on headless Linux. Next phase should add Carmack/RLEW map-plane decompression tests.

## Latest Verified Milestone

- Repo exists under `~/.openclaw/tmp/Wolfenstein 3D port`.
- Original id Software Wolfenstein 3D source is available at `source/original/` as a submodule.
- Local purchased game data is present under `game-files/base/` and ignored by git.
- Autopilot operating rules are documented in `docs/AUTOPILOT.md`.
- `source/original/` was inspected but not modified.
- `docs/research/source-inventory.md` records the first source/data inventory and practical test-driven porting strategy.
- `source/modern-c-sdl3` now contains the first pure C asset metadata harness (`wl_assets`) plus `make test` headless verification.
- `docs/research/asset-metadata-harness.md` records the implemented seam, assertions, and verification output.

## Verified Findings

### Source Architecture

- Original code is a Borland/DOS C codebase with inline assembly and separate `.ASM` modules.
- Reusable id subsystems are organized around:
  - `ID_CA.*` cache/data file loading and Huffman/Carmack/RLEW decompression.
  - `ID_MM.*` segmented DOS memory manager.
  - `ID_PM.*` VSWAP page manager with EMS/XMS/main-memory paging.
  - `ID_VL.*` / `ID_VH.*` VGA/palette/blit helpers.
  - `ID_IN.*`, `ID_SD.*`, `ID_US.*` input, sound, and UI helpers.
- Wolf-specific game files are organized around:
  - `WL_MAIN.C` startup/main loop.
  - `WL_MENU.C` extension/SKU detection and menus.
  - `WL_GAME.C` map loading and level setup.
  - `WL_ACT*.C`, `WL_AGENT.C`, `WL_STATE.C` actor/player behavior.
  - `WL_DRAW.C`, `WL_PLAY.C`, `WL_SCALE.C`, `CONTIGSC.C` rendering/raycast/scaling.
- `WL_MAIN.C::InitGame` initializes `MM`, video, input, page manager, sound, cache manager, and UI in that order, then builds lookup/render tables.
- `WL_MENU.C::CheckForEpisodes` chooses data extension (`WL6`, `WL3`, `WL1`, `SOD`, `SDM`, etc.) and appends it to global file-name stems.

### Data Files

Verified local WL6 data:

- `MAPHEAD.WL6`: 402 bytes; RLEW tag `0xabcd`; 100 map offset slots. Original `ID_CA.H` defines `NUMMAPS` as 60 for WL6 gameplay, so read the table generically but constrain first gameplay tests to the original playable map count.
- `GAMEMAPS.WL6`: 150,652 bytes; map 0 offset 2250; map 0 name `Wolf1 Map1`; dimensions 64x64; plane starts `(11, 1445, 2240)`; plane lengths `(1434, 795, 10)`.
- `VSWAP.WL6`: 1,544,376 bytes; `ChunksInFile=663`, `PMSpriteStart=106`, `PMSoundStart=542`; first offsets `4096,8192,12288,16384,20480`.
- `VGAHEAD.WL6`: 450 bytes; 3-byte graphics offsets.
- `VGADICT.WL6`: 1024 bytes.
- `VGAGRAPH.WL6`: 275,774 bytes.
- `AUDIOHED.WL6`: 1,156 bytes; first offsets `(0, 15, 28, 44, 102)`.
- `AUDIOT.WL6`: 320,209 bytes.

Verified optional SOD data under `game-files/base/m1`:

- `MAPHEAD.SOD`: 402 bytes; RLEW tag `0xabcd`; 100 map offset slots.
- `GAMEMAPS.SOD`: first map offset 2097; map 0 name `Tunnels 1`; dimensions 64x64.
- `VSWAP.SOD`: `ChunksInFile=666`, `PMSpriteStart=134`, `PMSoundStart=555`.

### Test Strategy

- Do not try to compile the full original DOS program as the first oracle; it is blocked by Borland headers, segmented memory, inline asm, DOS interrupts, VGA hardware, and EMS/XMS assumptions.
- Prefer pure modern C modules for original data transformations, with tests against local data-derived metadata/hashes.
- Best direct comparison targets: `CAL_CarmackExpand`, `CA_RLEWexpand`, `CAL_HuffExpand`, map/VSWAP/header parsing, fixed-point/table generation, and later spawn classification.
- Low-value exact comparisons: DOS memory placement, VGA planar side effects, compiled x86 scalers, hardware audio writes, and interrupt timing.

## Current Strategy

Target WL6 first, while keeping parsers flexible enough to validate SOD as optional secondary data. Build a deterministic asset/decompression foundation before adding SDL3 video/input/audio. Treat SDL3 as the platform boundary, not the first dependency.

Use tests as the bridge from the original code to modern C:

1. Asset locator + required file metadata test.
2. `MAPHEAD`/`GAMEMAPS` parser test.
3. Carmack + RLEW map-plane decompression test.
4. `VSWAP` parser/chunk descriptor test.
5. `VGAHEAD`/`VGADICT`/`VGAGRAPH` Huffman smoke test.

## Next Likely Move

Implement pure C Carmack expansion and RLEW expansion, then decode WL6 map 0 planes.

Recommended files for the next commit:

- extend `source/modern-c-sdl3/include/wl_assets.h` with decompression APIs
- extend `source/modern-c-sdl3/src/wl_assets.c` or add `src/wl_decompress.c`
- add tests that decode WL6 map 0 planes 0/1 into 4096-word arrays
- assert output sizes and stable hashes/counts rather than committing proprietary map bytes

The current metadata harness already verifies WL6 file sizes, `MAPHEAD.WL6` RLEW tag `0xabcd`, map 0 offset/header/name/dimensions, `VSWAP.WL6` header values, and optional SOD metadata.

## Blockers

None. SDL3 integration can safely wait until asset/decompression tests exist.


## Runtime Notes

- Target verification environment is headless Linux.
- Prefer automated CLI/build/unit tests over visual/manual checks.
- Autopilot is expected to continue overnight without asking ET for routine decisions.

## Cycle 2026-04-24 22:22 CDT

Action taken:

- Implemented first runnable modern C + SDL3-port test harness without requiring SDL yet.
- Added `wl_assets` module for local data path resolution, file-size checks, `MAPHEAD` parsing, `GAMEMAPS` map header parsing, and `VSWAP` header parsing.
- Added `source/modern-c-sdl3/Makefile` with strict C11 warnings-as-errors build.
- Added headless test runner `source/modern-c-sdl3/tests/test_assets.c`.
- Added `docs/research/asset-metadata-harness.md` with assertions and verification evidence.
- Updated root `.gitignore` to ignore `source/modern-c-sdl3/build/`.

Verification:

```bash
cd source/modern-c-sdl3
make test
```

Result:

```text
cc -Iinclude -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror -O2 -g src/wl_assets.c tests/test_assets.c -o build/test_assets
cd ../.. && source/modern-c-sdl3/build/test_assets
asset metadata tests passed for game-files/base
```

Safety/legal checks:

- Did not modify `source/original/`.
- Did not add or commit proprietary game data.
- Verified `game-files/base/MAPHEAD.WL6` and `game-files/base/VSWAP.WL6` remain ignored by `game-files/.gitignore`.
- Build artifact directory is ignored.

Next likely move:

- Add pure C Carmack + RLEW expansion and decode WL6 map 0 planes into 4096-word arrays with hash/count assertions.

Blockers: none.
